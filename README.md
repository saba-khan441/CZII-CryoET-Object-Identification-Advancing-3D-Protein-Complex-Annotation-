# CZII - CryoET Object Identification

**Advancing 3D Protein Complex Annotation with Deep Learning**

## Overview
Cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) enables high-resolution 3D reconstructions of cellular structures, providing critical insights into molecular arrangements.

However, identifying protein complexes remains challenging due to high noise, low contrast, and missing wedge artifacts.

This project introduces a YOLO-based deep learning model for detecting protein complexes in Cryo-ET images.

We utilize synthetic Cryo-ET data stored in Zarr format, apply preprocessing techniques, and refine detection with k-d tree spatial structures.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 3D tomograms and their corresponding ground truth annotations. 

The goal is to identify particle centers in tomograms and submit predictions for five scored particle types:

### Particle Types & Difficulty Levels

✅ Easy: apo-ferritin, ribosome, virus-like-particle

⚠️ Hard: beta-galactosidase, thyroglobulin

❌ Not scored: beta-amylase

## Dataset Structure

Train Data (train/)

Static Tomograms (train/static/ExperimentRuns/{experiment}/VoxelSpacing10.000/)

denoised.zarr/ → Contains tomographic data

Ground Truth (train/overlay/ExperimentRuns/{experiment}/Picks/)

{particle_type}.json → Contains particle coordinates

Test Data (test/)

Static Tomograms (test/static/ExperimentRuns/{experiment}/VoxelSpacing10.000/)

denoised.zarr/ → Contains tomographic data (without labels)
